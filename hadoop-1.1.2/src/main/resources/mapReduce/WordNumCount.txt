There is also a similar value, null
whose meaning is this value is defined
but it does not have a value
The difference in meaning between
undefined and null is mostly academic
and usually not very interesting
In practical programs
it is often necessary to check whether something has a value
In these cases the expression something is undefined may be used
because even though they are not exactly the same value
null is undefined will produce true
